formatters:
  enable:
    - goimports # checks if the code and import statements are formatted according to the 'goimports' command
    - gofumpt # Or "gofmt", # Enforce standard formatting

linters:
  enable:
    - errcheck #Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in Go code. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases.
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs. It is roughly the same as 'go vet' and uses its passes. [auto-fix]
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used. [fast]
    - staticcheck # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary. The author of staticcheck doesn't support or approve the use of staticcheck as a library inside golangci-lint. [auto-fix]
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types.

    # Subective additional linters
    - goclyco # or "cyclop", # Detect cyclomatic complexity
    - goconst # Detect repeated values that can be made constants
    - gofumpt # Or "gofmt", # Enforce standard formatting
    - goimports # Ensure standard import formatting/ordering
    - misspell # Fix spelling errors
    - unconvert # Detect unnecessary type conversions
    - unparam # Detect unused function parameters
    - dupword # Detect duplicate words in comments and string literals (e.g. “the the”, “is is”)
