    - errcheck #Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in Go code. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases.
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs. It is roughly the same as 'go vet' and uses its passes. [auto-fix]
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used. [fast]
    - staticcheck # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary. The author of staticcheck doesn't support or approve the use of staticcheck as a library inside golangci-lint. [auto-fix]
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types.
    # Subective additional linters
    - gocyclo # or "cyclop", # Detect cyclomatic complexity
    - goconst # Detect repeated values that can be made constants
    - misspell # Fix spelling errors
