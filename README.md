+ __Tiny__ one-shot monitoring service
+ __Remote__ configuration of independent 'dish network' (via loading the socket list to be checked from a remote API)
+ __Fast__ concurrent testing, low overall execution time, 10-sec timeout per socket by default
+ __Zero__ dependencies

## Use Cases

+ Lightweight health checks of HTTP and/or TCP sockets
+ Decentralized monitoring with standalone dish instances deployed on different hosts that pull configuration from a common API
+ Cron-driven one-shot checks without the need for any long-running agents

## Install

```shell
go install go.vxn.dev/dish/cmd/dish@latest
```

## Usage

```
dish [FLAGS] SOURCE
```

![dish run](.github/dish_run.png)

### Source

The list of sockets to be checked can be provided in 2 ways:

1. A local JSON file
   + E.g., the `./configs/demo_sockets.json` file included in this repository as an example.
2. A remote RESTful JSON API endpoint
   + The list of sockets retrieved from this endpoint can also be locally cached (see the `-cache`, `-cacheDir` and `-cacheTTL` flags below).
   + Using local cache prevents constant hitting of the endpoint when running checks in short, periodic intervals. It also enables dish to run its checks even if the remote endpoint is down using the cached list of sockets (if available), even when the cache is considered expired.

For the expected JSON schema of the list of sockets to be checked, see `./configs/demo_sockets.json`.

```bash
# local JSON file
dish /opt/dish/sockets.json

# remote JSON API source
dish http://restapi.example.com/dish/sockets/:instance
```

### Flags

```
dish -h
Usage of dish:
  -cache
        a bool, specifies whether to cache the socket list fetched from the remote API source
  -cacheDir string
        a string, specifies the directory used to cache the socket list fetched from the remote API source (default ".cache")
  -cacheTTL uint
        an int, time duration (in minutes) for which the cached list of sockets is valid (default 10)
  -hname string
        a string, name of a custom additional header to be used when fetching and pushing results to the remote API (used mainly for auth purposes)
  -hvalue string
        a string, value of the custom additional header to be used when fetching and pushing results to the remote API (used mainly for auth purposes)
  -machineNotifySuccess
        a bool, specifies whether successful checks with no failures should be reported to machine channels
  -name string
        a string, dish instance name (default "generic-dish")
  -target string
        a string, result update path/URL to pushgateway, plaintext/byte output
  -telegramBotToken string
        a string, Telegram bot private token
  -telegramChatID string
        a string, Telegram chat/channel ID
  -textNotifySuccess
        a bool, specifies whether successful checks with no failures should be reported to text channels
  -timeout uint
        an int, timeout in seconds for http and tcp calls (default 10)
  -updateURL string
        a string, API endpoint URL for pushing results
  -verbose
        a bool, console stdout logging toggle
  -webhookURL string
        a string, URL of webhook endpoint
```

### Alerting

When a socket test fails, it's always good to be notified. For this purpose, dish provides 4 different ways of doing so (can be combined):

+ Test results upload to a remote JSON API (using the `-updateURL` flag)
+ Check results as the Telegram message body (via the `-telegramBotToken` and `-telegramChatID` flags)
+ Failed count and last test timestamp update to Pushgateway for Prometheus (using the `-target` flag)
+ Test results push to a webhook URL (using the `-webhookURL` flag)

Whether successful runs with no failed checks should be reported can also be configured using flags:

+ `-textNotifySuccess` for text channels (e.g. Telegram)
+ `-machineNotifySuccess` for machine channels (e.g. webhooks, remote API or Pushgateway)

![telegram-alerting](/.github/dish_telegram.png)

(The screenshot above shows Telegram alerting as of `v1.10.0`. The screenshot shows the result of using the `-textNotifySuccess` flag to include successful checks in the alert as well.)

### Examples

One way to run dish is to build and install a binary executable.

```shell
# Fetch and install the specific version
go install go.vxn.dev/dish/cmd/dish@latest

export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin

# Load sockets from sockets.json file, and use Telegram 
# provider for alerting
dish -telegramChatID "-123456789" \
 -telegramBotToken "123:AAAbcD_ef" \
 sockets.json

# Use remote JSON API service as socket source, and push
# the results to Pushgateway
dish -target https://pushgw.example.com/ \
 https://api.example.com/dish/sockets
```

#### Using Docker

```shell
# Copy, and/or edit dot-env file (optional)
cp .env.example .env
vi .env

# Build a Docker image
make build

# Run using docker compose stack
make run

# Run using native docker run
docker run --rm \
 dish:1.10.4-go1.24 \
 -verbose \
 -target https://pushgateway.example.com \
 https://api.example.com
```

#### Bash script and cronjob

Create a bash script to easily deploy dish and update its settings:

```shell
vi tiny-dish-run.sh
```

```shell
#!/bin/bash

TELEGRAM_TOKEN="123:AAAbcD_ef"
TELEGRAM_CHATID="-123456789"

SOURCE_URL=https://api.example.com/dish/sockets
UPDATE_URL=https://api.example.com/dish/sockets/results
TARGET_URL=https://pushgw.example.com

DISH_TAG=dish:1.10.4-go1.24
INSTANCE_NAME=tiny-dish

API_TOKEN=AbCd

docker run --rm \
        ${DISH_TAG} \
        -name ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
        -hvalue ${API_TOKEN} \
        -hname X-Auth-Token \
        -target ${TARGET_URL} \
        -updateURL ${UPDATE_URL} \
        -telegramBotToken ${TELEGRAM_TOKEN} \
        -telegramChatID ${TELEGRAM_CHATID} \
        -timeout 15 \
        -verbose \
        ${SOURCE_URL}
```

Make it an executable:

```shell
chmod +x tiny-dish-run.sh
```

##### Cronjob to run periodically

```shell
crontab -e
```

```shell
# m h  dom mon dow   command
MAILTO=monitoring@example.com

*/2 * * * * /home/user/tiny-dish-run.sh
```
